# Case Study: Live brokerage Application

This project involves the development of a live brokerage application where users can place multiple bets on a single match, all at once. The application provides real-time updates on brokerage odds and supports various functionalities related to match and brokerage management.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Match and Odds Management**
   - Users can add new matches to the system. For each added match, dynamic brokerage odds are generated by the system.
   - Match Information includes:
     - League
     - Home Team Name
     - Away Team Name
     - Odds for Home Team Win (e.g., 1.22, 1.85, 2.32)
     - Odds for Draw
     - Odds for Away Team Win
     - Match Start Time
   - brokerage odds for matches will change randomly every second, ensuring that the odds do not guarantee winnings.

2. **Real-Time and Sorted Odds Display**
   - Users can view all matches and their odds changes in real-time.
   - The display of odds changes is sorted from the oldest to the newest.

3. **brokerage and Timeout Management**
   - Users can place up to 500 multiple bets on any match at any time.
   - brokerage odds changes will not affect ongoing bets.
   - Each bet has a timeout value of 2 seconds, which can be adjusted parametrically within the application.
